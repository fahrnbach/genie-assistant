✅ Industry-Standard Strategy (with Flexibility)

🅰️ Split the Chat Assistant into Its Own Reusable Repo
	•	Name: genie-assistant or genie-core
	•	Purpose: A portable, installable assistant with optional riddle-gate logic.
	•	Deployable as a serverless API or Docker container.
	•	Customizable frontend embed for any site (<script src="..."> or NPM component).
	•	Can expose:
	•	/riddle
	•	/verify
	•	/ask
	•	or even /config for branding/themes

✅ Benefits:
	•	Easier to maintain across multiple projects
	•	Reusable by other devs or teams
	•	You can publish a public version (e.g., @fahrnbach/genie-assistant)
